## About The Project

### I've built a simple web application using Laravel Version 8.2.5 in VSC IDE called MiniCRM0. 
### Mini-CRM, or human resources management system, is a suite of software applications used to manage human resources and related processes throughout the employee lifecycle. An HRMS enables a company to fully understand its workforce

## Installation
Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/khaledDerbass/MiniCRM0.git

In the root folder of the application, run the command

php artisan migrate --seed
This will run the migration files which will create the necessary tables and seed the users table with an admin user whose email is admin@admin.com and password password.

The migration command also assigns a role called Admin to the administrative user which can distinguish the administrative user from other users in the application.
